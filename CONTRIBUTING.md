Contributing
============

Any help, individual hacking, or contribution is very welcome! Here is a bit of help to get you started.

Environment
-----------

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and up-to-date, and a working installation of [Elm 0.17](http://elm-lang.org/).
Once you've cloned the repository, `cd` into it and install `npm` dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Building the whole project can be done with:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you run into any problems, start by cleaning the Elm build directory with `rm -r elm-stuff`, and rebuild. If the problem persists, [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/wehlutyk/gistr-app/issues/new)!

With that, you're ready to go!
