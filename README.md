Gistr
=====

Gistr is both a mobile "broken telephone" (or "chinese whispers") game and an
experiment in cognitive and social science, focusing on how we interpret
sentences.

It is developed for my PhD on interpretation and cultural evolution, and is
part of the [http://www.iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php?page=SEP](Science en Poche)
project encouraging the use of mobile devices in science and citizen
empowerment.
