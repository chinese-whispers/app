Gistr
=====

Gistr is both a mobile "broken telephone" (or "chinese whispers") game and an
experiment in cognitive and social science, focusing on how we make sense and
interpret.

It is developed for my PhD on interpretation and cultural evolution, and is
part of the [Science en Poche](http://www.iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php?page=SEP)
project which helps with the use of mobile devices in research and more
generally global-local situations.
